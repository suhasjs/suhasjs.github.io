I'm a final year Ph.D student in the CS Department at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Greg Ganger](https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/). My research focuses on improving the efficiency of large-scale machine learning infrastructure through better utilization of the underlying hardware. I'm broadly interested in systems research, with some focus on abstractions, performance and utilization in domain-specific systems like machine learning and graph porocessing systems.

I am currently working on developing responsive and efficient schedulers for large-scale deep learning clusters that host tens of thousands of heterogeneous GPUs. 

**I will be joining Microsoft as a Senior Researcher end of Summer 2025 where I will work on problems involving large-scale infrastructure related to vector-search and information retrieval pipelines**

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) on problems in Machine Learning and Systems. Our work (along with [Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy](https://rakri.github.io/)) resulted in a low-cost, low-latency approximate nearest neighbor search that now powers vector search in Bing Web Search and other enterprise search offerings. In ancient times, I have worked on some topics in reinforcement learning and natural language generation systems.
